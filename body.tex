\paragraph{Idea:} The key idea of \emph{Instrument Flight Rules} (IFR) is to provide additional surveillance resulting into better air traffic knowledge, weather and situation awareness. 

The situation is different in case of UAS, the combination of human pilot decisions and surveillance provided information is replaced by single autonomous agent. The main challenge is to replicate human pilot data fusion process leading to \emph{situation awareness} and later decision making process leading to \emph{aircraft control}.

\paragraph{Instrument Flight Rules:} By definition \cite{icaoAnnex2}, \emph{Implementation of Visual Flight Rules under weather or other conditions}. The main goal of IFR is to keep aircraft separated and with clearance.

The \emph{separation} of \emph{aircraft} is main responsibility of \emph{Air Traffic Control} (ATC) which is providing IFR aircraft with guidance.

There is a minimum equipment which needs to be carried by aircraft to be considered IFR airworthiness \cite{icao4444}. The minimal equipment to be carried for IFR flight in European Airspace (EuroControl) is given as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{GPS} - mandatory for all flight levels in controlled airspace. 
    
    \item \emph{Transmitter} - the way to communicate with ATC/Ground. There can be digital transmitter equipment to receive automatic warnings from TCAS/ACAS systems, \emph{ATC directives}, and, notices to airman (NOTAMS).
    
    \item \emph{Transponder} - the broadcasting device giving out aircraft position and additional mandatory information. The current plan is to make ADS-B In/Out mandatory for all air traffic attendants.
    
    \item \emph{Barometric Altimeter} - to measure precise AMSL altitude.
\end{enumerate}


\begin{note}
    Carried does not mean used. Most of the pilots in UK believe that usage of GPS is illegal and they avoid it in small private flights in controlled airspace.
    
    The other popular practice is to turn off \emph{transponder}, because planes tend to hide their position and heading for safety reasons.
\end{note}

\paragraph{Required Navigation Performance:} The required navigation performance is depending on \emph{flight level} where the \emph{Flight Plan} (Mission) is executed. The \emph{planned trajectory deviation} is key performance parameter \cite{icao4444}.
